## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
I developed a condensed version of an Instagram profile page for this assignment, concentrating on CSS design and layout. This required using a variety of CSS techniques to produce a visually beautiful, responsive design that works well on a range of devices.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I dont feel entirely confident in using Flexbox and Grid to structure web page elements. Implementing these techniques to align and distribute content was a beign of my learning experience.
- **Responsive Design**: I successfully implemented media queries to ensure the page looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style the profile image, user information, and gallery section adequetly, closely resembling an Instagram profile.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: Adjusting layouts and font sizes for smaller screens was challenging to say the least. I had to experiment with different approaches to ensure the design remained consistent and functional while still maintaining the brief.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: the hover effects were able to function well, however, having to hide some of the elements in the text was difficult.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I want to explore more advanced CSS properties and animations to enhance the user experience.
- **Code Optimization**: While my code achieved the desired outcome, I believe I can improve its efficiency and readability as well as the desired layout.
- **Creative Design Choices**: I adhered closely to the Instagram layout for practice but would like to experiment with more creative design choices in future projects that dont have a recognisable setup.

#### Overall Learning Experience

my overall learning experience was filled with many challenges and obstacles I had to overcome. Although there are still avenues that I'm not entirely sure how to explore, there are still many learning opportunities that lie ahead.
